# Polito Comm Systems Project

Here will reside all of our code...

## Database
- Professor suggested MS SQL Server or MySQL
- _Suggestion:_ For development, [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) with [SQLite DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) may be easier (database contained in a single file inside this same folder, no extra setup)

## Web Service

- Professor suggested Python.

- From researching a bit the existing frameworks, FastAPI is modern, popular and seems really promising & simple to learn. 

- The best feature IMO is automatic documentation & interactive testing interface generation, that will be so useful when developing the clients.

- You can get up to speed with APIs, automatic documentation and the modern FastAPI framework for developing web services in Python with this 1h video: [Python FastAPI tutorial by TechWithTim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykeT6kk4bk)

- I've created a skeleton fastAPI project already, you can already run it, but it's just what gets created by default with PyCharm IDE: a "hello world" endpoint.

## Front-end

- Professor suggested Flutter & Dart
